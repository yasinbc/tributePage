					<h3 class="h3">Professional career</h3>
					<li>On June 28, <b>1940</b> Muhammad Yunus was born in Bathus,  Chenamoti, Bangladesh. He was the 3rd of 9 siblings from a non-practicing Muslim family. His father was Hazi Dula and his mother Sufia Khatun. His early childhood years were spent in his humble village.</li>
					<li><b>1944</b> his family moved to Chittagong, Bangladesh and moved from the village school to Lamabzar Primary School.</li>
					<li><b>1949</b> he matriculated at the Chittagong Collegiate School where he was ranked 16th out of 39,000 students, even though that same year before his matriculation his mother was diagnosed with a psychological illness.</li>
					<li><b>1957</b> he entered the Department of Economics at the University of Dhaka and completed his bachelor's degree in 1960 and a master's degree in 1961.</li>
					<li><b>1961</b> was a lecturer in economics at Chittagong University while founding a packing factory on his own.</li>
					<li><b>1965</b> he received a Fulbright scholarship to study in the United States. He received his Ph.D. in economics from Vanderbilt University's Program in Economics Development Department (GPED) in 1971.  From 1969 to 1972, Yunus was an assistant professor of economics at Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro. </li>
					<li><b>1971</b> During the Bangladesh Liberation War Yunus founded a citizens' committee and the Bangladesh Information Center with other Bengalis in the United States to increase support for liberation. He also published the Bangladesh Fact Sheet from his home in Nashville.</li>
					<li><b>1974</b> After observing the famine left by the war, Yunus became involved in poverty reduction by establishing a rural economic program as a research project. </li>
					<li><b>1976</b> during his visits to the slums of Chittagong he discovered that small loans could have a huge positive impact on the local economy. Village women who made bamboo furniture had to accept usurious loans from gangsters who would not let them grow.  Yunus began by lending $27 USD from his own pocket to 42 women in his village who made a profit of 0.5 taka ($0.02 USD) on each loan. This is why Muhammad Yunus is credited with coming up with the idea of micro-lending along with Dr. Akhtar Hameed Khan.</li>
					<li>In December <b>1976</b> he got a loan from Jatan Bank to lend to the poor people of Jorba.</li>
					<li>In <b>1982</b> his bank had 28,000 members and was renamed Grameen Bank (people's bank). They faced all sorts of social, political and religious pressures as more than 94% of the micro credits they granted were to women in extreme poverty, <strong><i>this granted the economic and social liberation of many women in an area where the predominant ideology was that of women's submission to men.</i></strong> By July 2007, Grameen Bank had granted $6.38 billion to 7.4 million people with a return rate of 96 to 98%.</li>
					<li>By <b>1986</b> the Grameen Bank diversified into different assets all dedicated to social entrepreneurship for fisheries, agricultural irrigation, agriculture, textile development and telephony, managing to modernize communications by delivering telephones to more than 256,000 poor people in more than 50,000 villages.</li>
					<li>In <b>2006</b> Muhammad Yunus was the first Bengali to receive the Nobel Peace Prize along with the Grameen Bank for his efforts to create a prosperous social and economic environment.</li>
					<li>In addition to the Nobel Peace Prize, he received the Presidential Freedom Award, the Congressional Gold Medal (these two together with the Nobel Peace Prize being awards that <strong><i>only 7 people in the world have received, Yunus being one of them</i></strong>), the Ramon Magsaysay Award in 1984, the World Food Prize, the International Simon Bolivar Award (1996), the Principe de Asturias Award for Concord, the Sydney Peace Prize in 1998 and the Seoul Peace Prize in 2006.He has also been awarded 50 honorary doctorates from universities in 20 different countries and 113 international awards from 26 different countries, including state honors from 10 countries. The government of Bangladesh released a commemorative stamp for its Nobel Prize winner. </li>
					<li>In January <b>2008</b> the city of Houston, Texas declared January 14 "Muhammad Yunus Day". </li>
					<li>In March <b>2012</b> Fortune Magazine named Muhammad Yunus one of the 12 greatest entrepreneurs of the current era. In this citation, Fortune Magazine said ″Yunus's idea inspired countless young people to dedicate themselves to social causes around the world″. In January 2012, Yunus was featured in the book Transformational Entrepreneurs: How Walt Disney, Steve Jobs, Muhammad Yunus and Other Innovators Achieved Success by Jeffrey Harris.</li>
					<li>Muhammad Yunus is a shining example of how poverty can be eradicated by appealing to individual freedoms of free entrepreneurship without government charity schemes.</li>
